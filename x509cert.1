.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool to generate X.509 certificates and certificate requests.
.Pp
The
.Ar key
must be a PEM-encoded RSA or EC private key in raw or PKCS#8 format.
Keys can be generated using the
.Xr brssl 1
tool.
.Pp
The
.Ar subject
is given as an RFC 4514 string representation of an X.501
DistinguishedName.
For example,
.Qq C=US,CN=example.com .
If not given, an empty DN is used.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Set the CA flag in a
.Em basicConstraints
extension.
This indicates that the subject is a certificate authority, and its
public key can be used to verify certificates.
.It Fl c
The certificate of the authority with which to sign the certificate.
The corresponding key must be given with the
.Fl k
option.
.It Fl k
The private key to sign the certificate with.
The corresponding certificate must be given with the
.Fl c
option.
.It Fl s
The serial number in the resulting certificate, given as a hexadecimal
string of at most 16 bytes.
If not specified, a random 16 byte serial is generated using
.Xr getentropy 3 .
.It Fl b
The Unix time at which the certificate becomes valid.
If not specified, defaults to the current time.
.It Fl d
The duration for which the certificate is valid, in seconds.
If followed by
.Sq d
or
.Sq y ,
the duration is in units of days or years respectively.
If the duration is
.Sq -1 ,
the time 99991231235959Z is used for the
.Em notAfter
field, meaning there is no well-defined expiration.
If not specified, defaults to 30 days.
.It Fl a
Add a
.Em subjectAltName
extension containing a
.Em dNSName
given by
.Ar altname .
May be specified multiple times.
.It Fl r
Generate a
.Em CertificateRequest
instead of a
.Em Certificate .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Generate a self-signed certificate with a common name of example.com
using the private key in
.Pa key.pem .
.Pp
.Dl x509cert CN=example.com key.pem > cert.pem
.Pp
Generate a certificate request for example.org with alternate name
www.example.org.
.Pp
.Dl x509cert -r -a www.example.org CN=example.org key.pem > req.pem
